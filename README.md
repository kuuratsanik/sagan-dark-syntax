# Sagan Dark Syntax theme

A syntax theme subtly inspired by the colors of the cosmos.

Using a color picker and various photos of nebulae, planets, and other celestial bodies I populated this syntax's colors with colors found from our own solar system to deep space. Though I've purposely made the colors somewhat subdued for more comfortable viewing, rest assured these are no ordinary colors. (Even though, really, they are.)

## Installation

Simply search "sagan-dark-syntax" within Atom's integrated package installer. (Settings/Preferences > Install) Alternatively, you can also install via console by entering:
